🎨 Frontend Details

🎭 HTML / CSS / JavaScript Frontend
The frontend uses basic web technologies to keep things lightweight and simple.

🧱 Bootstrap Template (StartBootstrap)
Since my main expertise is backend development, the site’s UI is based on a free template from startbootstrap.com.

💻 All Backend Logic Written by Me
Only the visual layout comes from the template — every backend feature, logic, and interaction is fully implemented by myself.
This project is recommended for Backend developing and logics.
